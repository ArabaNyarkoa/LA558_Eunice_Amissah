## Assessing Homelessness in the United States

## Abstract
Homelessness is a complex issue that affects millions of people in the United States. It is caused by a combination of factors including poverty, lack of affordable housing, job loss, and mental illness. Homelessness disproportionately affects specific populations, such as veterans, families with children, and individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. The impact of homelessness extends beyond just housing insecurity, it affects physical and mental health, access to education and employment opportunities, and overall quality of life. Addressing homelessness requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that includes access to affordable housing, healthcare, education, and job training. Addressing homelessness is critical for ensuring the well-being and stability of individuals and communities. This project seeks to visualize places where categories of homelessness are prevalent with the help of  Tableau.

## Overview
Homelessness is a complex issue that affects millions of people worldwide. It encompasses a wide range of circumstances and conditions, from those who are temporarily homeless to those who are chronically homeless. The effects of homelessness are far-reaching and can impact not only individuals but also entire communities. This problem affects not only the homeless but also the rest of society. It is therefore imperative that we work together to find solutions to this complex and persistent problem.

One of the key causes of homelessness is poverty. Many people who are homeless live in poverty and lack the resources to secure stable housing. For example, low-income workers who are unable to make ends meet, individuals living with disabilities, and people who have experienced job loss or other financial crises may find themselves without a home. Additionally, a lack of affordable housing is another major contributor to homelessness. In many cities, the cost of housing has risen faster than wages, making it difficult for low-income families to find affordable places to live.

Another factor that contributes to homelessness is mental illness. Many people who are homeless struggle with mental health problems, and these issues can make it difficult for them to maintain stable housing. Substance abuse is also a common issue among the homeless population. This is often a result of people turning to drugs and alcohol to self-medicate and escape the difficulties of homelessness. This creates a vicious cycle, as substance abuse can further undermine a person's ability to maintain stable housing and employment.

## Technology
I will use Tableau to accomplish this task as it will provide great visuals and a breakdown of homelessness in various states in the United States.

## Data
Data that would be used for the project will be obtained from the following sites:
•	U.S. Census – Population Data
•	United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Dataset - homelessness by state and year (2017-2020)
o	 total number of persons experiencing homelessness, 
o	counts of homeless individuals, 
o	counts of chronically homeless individuals, 
o	counts of homeless people in families, 
o	counts of homeless family households, 
o	counts of homeless Veterans, and 
o	whether or not these people were sheltered or unsheltered.

## Inspiration
I am currently working on an independent study on homelessness. I decided to look for similar projects and literature done that delve into homelessness and visuals that help put it in perspective. The following resources helped inspire the project:

o	Homelessness Resources | HUD.gov / U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

o	Lee, B. A., Shinn, M., & Culhane, D. P. (2021). Homelessness as a Moving Target. The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 693(1), 8–26. https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716221997038

## Potential Challenges

o Access to the data needed to accomplish the project. The websites that inspired the project list sources of data but upon checking the pages or sites, I have been unable to determine where the data can be extracted. 

o This will also mean there would be much cleaning and analyzing of the data to make it relevant for the project. This could lead to a possible delay in completing the project.

o Unfamiliarity with Tableau will be one of the challenges I will face as a first-time user of the software. Datacamp and the videos from class have been helpful. I hope this will not be overwhelming to undertake.

## Timeline

I hope to accomplish the following tasks on the following dates:

•	Apr 5 – Data collected

•	Apr 14 – Data cleaned and loaded within Tableau

•	Apr 21 – Start creating visuals in Tableau

•	Apr 30 – Completed Project
