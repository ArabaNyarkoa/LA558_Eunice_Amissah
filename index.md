- Map 1 [OpenStreet](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=38.9353&mlon=-95.2154#map=16/38.9353/-95.2154&layers=N)
- Map 2 [PDF Map](Assignments/Assign3a_Eunice.pdf) I used a geoprocessing tool to find trails nearest to parks and bike lanes nearest to trails. 
- Map 3 [GIS2WebPlugin](Assignments/CVAqgis2web/index.html)
- Combined Maps [All3a](Assignments/CombinedMaps.html)

### Assignment 2

  - [Assignment 2](Assignment2/Assign2.md) - I created a google sheet that shows basketball players, teams, states, and their championships won. I found and displayed the percentage of wins with a plot. 
Map 1 represents Iowa Public School K-12 English Learners(EL) by District and Grade for the years 2022-2023. County names and some selected grades were used for the map. 
Map 2 represents K-12 English Learners for selected grades in the State of Iowa, grouped on County basis. A excel file was used.


### Plot
Experimented with Google sheets as well to create the chart below.
